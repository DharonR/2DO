# LifeOS

LifeOS is a simple life management app built with React Native and Expo. It helps forgetful people remember everything and stay on task by combining reminders and notes in one place.

## Features

- Create reminders with scheduled dates and mark them complete.
- Jot down quick notes to capture ideas or information.

This project started as a basic reminders app and is evolving into a personal LifeOS.
